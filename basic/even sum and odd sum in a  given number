# Write a program to input an integer N and print the sum of all its even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.
# Digits mean numbers, not the places!
# That is, if the given integer is "13245", even digits are 2 & 4 and odd digits are 1, 3 & 5.




n = int(input('Enter the number:'))
even = 0
odd = 0
while n > 0:
    a = n%10
    n = n//10
    if a%2==0:
        even = even+a
    else:
        odd = odd + a
print(even)
print(odd)
